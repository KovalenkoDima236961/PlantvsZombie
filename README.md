<h1>University Project on the Subject ZTIAPL</h1>
<p>Welcome to the documentation for my university project on the subject ZTIAPL. The aim of this project was to create a web game using JavaScript in an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) style. I'm excited to        share my game, which is a web-based version of the popular "Plants vs. Zombies" game, but with a twist â€“ it's now "People vs. Zombies".</p>
    
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
    
<p>The main objective was to develop a fully functional web game that demonstrates the principles of OOP. My rendition of "People vs. Zombies" includes engaging gameplay, strategic elements, and increasing difficulty across multiple levels.</p>

  <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Three Levels:</strong> The game consists of three distinct levels, each designed to provide a unique challenge. As players progress through the levels, they will encounter different environments and obstacles.</li>
        <li><strong>Final Bosses:</strong> Each level culminates in a showdown with a unique final boss. These bosses are designed to test the player's strategy and skills, ensuring a thrilling climax to each level.</li>
        <li><strong>OOP Design:</strong> The game is implemented using JavaScript with a strong emphasis on Object-Oriented Programming. This approach not only enhances code readability and maintainability but also allows for more complex game mechanics and interactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive Gameplay:</strong> Players must strategically place people to fend off waves of zombies. Each person and zombie type has unique characteristics, adding depth and variety to the gameplay.</li>
        <li><strong>Engaging Graphics:</strong> The game features visually appealing graphics that draw players into the action and enhance the overall gaming experience.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<ol>
        <li><strong>Starting the Game:</strong> Start the game "People vs. Zombies".</li>
        <li><strong>Choosing a Level:</strong> Choose one of the proposed game levels in which you will defend yourself against zombies by installing different defenders.</li>
        <li><strong>Controls:</strong> The game is controlled with the mouse.</li>
        <li><strong>Placing People:</strong> The player can place people (defenders) on the lawn by hovering over an empty cell with a black square. To summon additional defenders, hover over the top bar and select from the options.</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic Attack:</strong> When zombies appear, your defenders will automatically attack them. Place your defenders strategically to stop the zombies before they reach your home.</li>
        <li><strong>Earning and Spending Money:</strong> For every zombie you destroy, you get money that can be used to buy new defenders and improve existing ones.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Development Process</h2>
<p>The development of this game involved several key stages:</p>
<ul>
        <li><strong>Planning:</strong> Defining the game mechanics, level design, and overall structure of the project.</li>
        <li><strong>Design:</strong> Creating the visual assets and designing the user interface.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Writing the game code using JavaScript, with a focus on OOP principles to manage game objects and interactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Continuously testing the game to ensure smooth gameplay, fixing bugs, and optimizing performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback and Iteration:</strong> Gathering feedback from peers and iterating on the design and functionality to improve the overall experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project has been a rewarding experience, allowing me to apply OOP principles in a practical context and create an enjoyable game. I hope you enjoy playing my web version of "People vs. Zombies" as much as I enjoyed developing it.</p>
